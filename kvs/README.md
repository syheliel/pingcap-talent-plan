# task 2(Done)
```
kvs set <KEY> <VALUE>
```
Set the value of a string key to a string
```
kvs get <KEY>
```
Get the string value of a given string key
```

# task 3(Done)
Modify your clap setup to set these values(set the name, version, authors, and description (if not, do so)) from standard cargo environment variables.
# task 4:Store values in memory
Now that your command line scaffolding is done, let's turn to the implementation of KvStore, and make the remaining test cases pass.

The behavior of KvStore's methods are fully-defined through the test cases themselves â€” you don't need any further description to complete the code for this project.

Make the remaining test cases pass by implementing methods on KvStore.
